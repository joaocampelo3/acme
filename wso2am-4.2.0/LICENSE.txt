            into the next annual period. All instances of Software in production and otherwise must be identified in the
            Order.

      5.2   Increases in Software Use. Subscriber may increase its use of the Software during the Subscription Period

      5.3   Bursting Use. Subscriber may temporarily exceed the Subscription limits, at no extra Fee, within the
            bursting limits for the Product ("Authorized Bursting Use"). If Subscriber increases its use beyond

            Authorized Bursting Use allows up to 3 days (discrete 24-hour periods) within an annual Subscription period
            during which the core count may exceed the Subscription limit by no more than 25%. For products limited to a
            maximum number of monthly transactions, Authorized Bursting Use allows transactions up to 25% over the
            monthly cap, within a single calendar month per annual Subscription period.

            for renewal are due according to the Fees and Payment terms of this Agreement.

      5.5   Termination for Change in Services. WSO2 may change the terms of Support or Services from time to time and
            these changes are effective when made, without affecting the validity of this Agreement. In the event of any
            material changes, WSO2 will attempt to provide Subscriber notice by sending an email to the point of contact
            address provided by Subscriber. In the event of a material and adverse change to the terms of Support or
            Services, Subscriber has the right to terminate this Agreement upon 30 days' prior written notice to WSO2 at
            the following email address: support@wso2.com. In the event of such termination, WSO2 shall reimburse
            Subscriber a pro rata amount of any fees actually prepaid by Subscriber.

      5.6   Audit. Upon WSO2's request with reasonable notice, Subscriber will permit technical and operational audits
            of Subscriber related to the subject matter of this Agreement. Audits may include verifying Subscriber's

            within Subscriber's regular business hours and WSO2 will honor confidentiality and data protection
            requirements. If non-compliance is discovered in an audit, Subscriber will be responsible for all costs
            associated with carrying out such audit. In addition, where such audit reveals Subscriber has exceeded the
            usage subscribed-for, Subscriber shall pay WSO2 prorated fees for the excess usage at the same rate(s)
            designated in the most proximate Order. If the date excess usage began cannot be determined to WSO2's
            satisfaction, excess usage shall be deemed to have commenced on the start date of the Subscription.

      services WSO2 may offer to Subscriber are subject to the following terms.

      6.1   Consulting Services Terms. WSO2 provides on-site and remote consulting services according to the

            provision or receipt of Services under this Agreement until one hundred eighty (180) calendar days following
            the termination of the person's or entity's employment or engagement with the other party. For purposes
            herein, "solicit" does not include broad-based recruiting efforts, including without limitation help wanted
            advertising and posting of open positions on a party's internet site. If You hire or engage directly or
            indirectly any personnel of WSO2 in violation of this section, You will pay WSO2 a contractual penalty equal
            to three times the monthly billing rate (assuming 168 hours per month) for such personnel.

  7.  Reseller Orders. This Section applies if You purchase Subscription through an authorized reseller of WSO2
      ("Reseller").

            payment from the Reseller.

      7.2   Instead of an Order submitted to WSO2, Your order details will be as stated in the order placed with WSO2
            by the Reseller on Your behalf, and the Reseller is responsible for the accuracy of any such order as
            communicated to WSO2.

      7.3   If You are entitled to a refund under this Agreement, then unless otherwise specified by WSO2, WSO2 will
            refund any applicable fees to the Reseller and the Reseller will be solely responsible for refunding the
            appropriate amounts to You.

      7.4   Resellers are not authorized to modify this Agreement or make any promises or commitments on WSO2's
            behalf, and WSO2 is not bound by any obligations to You other than as set forth in this Agreement.

      7.5   The amount paid or payable by the Reseller to WSO2 for Your use of the applicable Software under this
            Agreement will be deemed the amount actually paid or payable by You to WSO2 under this Agreement for
            purposes of calculating the liability cap in Section 13.

  8.  Publicity and Feedback

      8.1   WSO2 Logos. WSO2 products may include features for theming the product user interfaces. You will retain the

  9.  Fees and Payment

      9.1   Fees. After You authorize an Order, upon renewal of a Subscription, or for other fees due to WSO2, WSO2 will
            send you an invoice. You will pay all fees specified in invoices. All payments are due within 30 calendar
            days of receipt of an invoice from WSO2 and are non-refundable. WSO2 may suspend or cancel performance of
            all or part of the Subscription or Services and may change its credit terms (after notifying You) if actual
            payment is not received within 60 calendar days of Your receipt of WSO2's invoice. Payments past due 60
            calendar days will incur interest at the rate of 1.5% per month or the highest rate permitted by law,
            whichever is less. You will also pay all costs incurred by WSO2 to collect undisputed amounts due, including
             legal fees, whether or not litigation is commenced.

      9.2   Taxes. All fees are exclusive of any applicable Taxes. You will pay to WSO2 an amount equal to any taxes
            arising from or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation, sales, service, use or value
            added taxes, which are paid by or are payable by WSO2. "Taxes" means any form of taxation, levy, duty,
            customs fee, charge, contribution or impost of whatever nature and by whatever authority imposed
            (including without limitation any fine, penalty, surcharge or interest), excluding, however, any taxes
            based solely on the net income of WSO2. If You are required under any applicable law or regulation,
            domestic or foreign, to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to WSO2, then the sum payable
            to WSO2 will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an amount equal to the sum it
            would have received had Subscriber made no withholdings or deductions.

      9.3   Purchase Orders. Any pre-printed terms on any purchase order that is issued by You that are in addition to
            or in conflict with the terms of this Agreement are null and void.

            any changes or amendments to this Agreement. "Affiliate" means any entity that directly or indirectly
            controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party to this Agreement.

      14.2  Exclusions. Confidential Information does not include information that:
            a.  was lawfully known or received by the receiving party prior to disclosure;
            b.  is or becomes part of the public domain other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement;

      16.10 Agreement to Governing Law and Dispute Resolution. Each party agrees to the applicable governing law above,
            and to the exclusive method of dispute resolution. Where the applicable dispute resolution procedure is
            arbitration, the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties, and judgment
            may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in the above provision prevents either party
            from applying to a court of competent jurisdiction for equitable or injunctive relief. Any dispute or other
            action arising out of this Agreement must be brought within one year of the date the cause of action accrued
            . An action for nonpayment may be brought within two years of the date of last payment.

                  taxes arising from or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation, GST, use or value
                  added taxes, which are paid by or are payable by WSO2. "Taxes" means any form of taxation, levy,
                  duty, customs fee, charge, contribution or impost of whatever nature and by whatever authority
                  imposed (including without limitation any fine, penalty, surcharge or interest), excluding, however,
                  any taxes based solely on the net income of WSO2. If You are required under any applicable law or
                  regulation, domestic or foreign, to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to WSO2, then
                  the sum payable to WSO2 will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an amount
                  equal to the sum it would have received had Subscriber made no withholdings or deductions.

                  Where a supply under this Agreement is a taxable supply, all amounts payable or other consideration
                  provided must be increased by the amount of GST payable in relation to the supply. All GST must be
                  paid at the time any payment for any supply to which it relates is payable (provided a valid tax
                  invoice has been issued for the supply). In this Section, "GST", "tax invoice" and "taxable supply"
                  have the meanings given to them in the A New Tax Systems (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth).

                  BE UNLIMITED, WSO2'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
                  THIS AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), IS LIMITED IN ANY CALENDAR
                  YEAR TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY SUBSCRIBER FOR SERVICES DURING THAT CALENDAR YEAR. IF YOU HAVE PAID NO

                  YOU IS $100.

                  AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY OF THE FOREGOING ARE FORESEEABLE, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER WSO2
                  HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING. THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY REGARDLESS
                  OF THE BASIS OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, MISREPRESENTATION, BREACH, DEFAMATION, INFRINGEMENT
                  OF PUBLICITY, PRIVACY, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR ANY OTHER CONTRACT OR TORT CLAIM.

                  rate (assuming 168 hours per month) for such personnel. You agree that the said amount is a genuine

                  based solely on the net income of WSO2. If You are required under any applicable law or regulation,
                  domestic or foreign, to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to WSO2, then the sum
                  payable to WSO2 will be increased by the amount necessary so that WSO2 receives an amount equal to the
                  sum it would have received had Subscriber made no withholdings or deductions. In such cases You shall
                  also deposit with the tax authorities and within the time required under law, the withheld or deducted
                  amount and shall provide WSO2 with the relevant certificates in relation thereto.

            16.1  Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
                  contrary to law, in whole or in part, this Agreement will be interpreted and construed as if such
                  provision had never been included herein. The remaining part of such provision and all other
                  provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. In such event, the parties
                  undertake to endeavor in good faith to replace the said provision by a valid, legal, and enforceable
                  provision which contains, as nearly as possible, the rights and obligations contained in the provision
                  to be replaced.
